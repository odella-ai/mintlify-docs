## How Your AI Employees Use Templates

Your AI employees handle the entire document generation process:

1. **Receive the Task** - You delegate work via email, chat, or Slack: "Draft the client onboarding package for XYZ Corp"
2. **Gather the Data** - The AI employee extracts relevant information from attachments, correspondence, databases, or other sources
3. **Select Templates** - Automatically chooses the appropriate template(s) from your firm's precedents
4. **Populate Documents** - Fills in all fields, handles conditional logic, performs calculations, and generates professional output
5. **Deliver Results** - Returns completed documents ready for your review
